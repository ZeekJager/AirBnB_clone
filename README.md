# AirBnB Clone Project- The Console
![AirBnB Logo](https://github.com/ZeekJager/AirBnB_clone/assets/118669208/e9651256-2f86-450a-94c7-7d480c6bcb79)

## Project Description
An AirBnB clone is a web or mobile application that replicates the features and functionalities of the popular vacation rental platform, AirBnB. It allows users to search for and book short-term accommodations such as apartments, houses, and rooms from hosts around the world. The clone typically includes features such as user profiles, messaging systems, booking calendars, payment gateways, and review systems. While there are many AirBnB clones available in the market, they may differ in terms of their pricing models, user interfaces, and additional features such as property management tools and marketing services.

This is the first part of the AirBnB clone project where we worked on the backend of the project whiles interfacing it with a console application with the help of the cmd module in python.

Data (python objects) generated are stored in a json file and can be accessed with the help of the json module in python

## Description of the command interpreter:
A console is a command-line interface that allows users to interact with a software application through a series of text commands. In an AirBnB clone, the console can be used to manage various aspects of the application, such as user accounts, listings, reservations, and payments.

This command line interpreter  serves as the frontend of the web app where users can interact with the backend which was developed with python OOP programming.

Some common commands that can be executed in an AirBnB clone console include:

The console can also be used to perform administrative tasks such as monitoring application performance, generating reports, and analyzing user data. Overall, the console is an essential tool for managing and maintaining an AirBnB clone application.
The interface of the application is just like the Bash shell except that this has a limited number of accepted commands that were solely defined for the purposes of the usage of the AirBnB website.

## Commands

    * create - Creates an instance based on given class
     
    * destroy - Destroys an object based on class and UUID

    * show - Shows an object based on class and UUID

    * all - Shows all objects the program has access to, or all objects of a given class

    * update - Updates existing attributes an object based on class name and UUID

    * quit - Exits the program (EOF will as well)

##### Alternative Syntax
Users are able to issue a number of console command using an alternative syntax:

	Usage: <class_name>.<command>([<id>[name_arg value_arg]|[kwargs]])
 
Advanced syntax is implemented for the following commands: 

    * all - Shows all objects the program has access to, or all objects of a given class

	* count - Return number of object instances by class

    * show - Shows an object based on class and UUID

  	* destroy - Destroys an object based on class and UUID

    * update - Updates existing attributes an object based on class name and UUID


## How to start it
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine (Linux distro) for development and testing purposes.

## Installing

You will need to clone the repository of the project from Github. This will contain the simple shell program and all of its dependencies.

```
git clone https://github.com/jzamora5/AirBnB_clone.git
```
After cloning the repository you will have a folder called AirBnB_clone. In here there will be several files that allow the program to work.

> /console.py : The main executable of the project, the command interpreter.
>
> models/engine/file_storage.py: Class that serializes instances to a JSON file and deserializes JSON file to instances
> 
> models/__ init __.py:  A unique `FileStorage` instance for the application
> 
> models/base_model.py: Class that defines all common attributes/methods for other classes.
> 
> models/user.py: User class that inherits from BaseModel
> 
>models/state.py: State class that inherits from BaseModel
>
>models/city.py: City class that inherits from BaseModel
>
>models/amenity.py: Amenity class that inherits from BaseModel
>
>models/place.py: Place class that inherits from BaseModel
>
>models/review.py: Review class that inherits from BaseModel



## How to use it
It can work in two different modes:


**Interactive** and **Non-interactive**.

In **Interactive mode**, the console will display a prompt (hbnb) indicating that the user can write and execute a command. After the command is run, the prompt will appear again a wait for a new command. This can go indefinitely as long as the user does not exit the program.

```
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit

(hbnb) 
(hbnb) 
(hbnb) quit
$
```

In **Non-interactive mode**, the shell will need to be run with a command input piped into its execution so that the command is run as soon as the Shell starts. In this mode no prompt will appear, and no further input will be expected from the user.


```
$ echo "help" | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb) 
$
$ cat test_help
help
$
$ cat test_help | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb) 
$
```

## Format of Command Input

In order to give commands to the console, these will need to be piped through an echo in case of  **Non-interactive mode**.

In  **Interactive Mode**  the commands will need to be written with a keyboard when the prompt appears and will be recognized when an enter key is pressed (new line). As soon as this happens, the console will attempt to execute the command through several means or will show an error message if the command didn't run successfully. In this mode, the console can be exited using the **CTRL + D** combination,  **CTRL + C**, or the command **quit** or **EOF**.

## Arguments

Most commands have several options or arguments that can be used when executing the program. In order for the Shell to recognize those parameters, the user must separate everything with spaces.

Example:

```

zekarias@zekarias-virtual-machine:~/AirBnB_clone$ ./console.py 
(hbnb) create BaseModel
e1b1288b-c6b5-487b-8b6f-cbd18a685fb6

```

or

```
zekarias@zekarias-virtual-machine:~/AirBnB_clone$ ./console.py $ echo "create BaseModel" | ./console.py
(hbnb)
40df892a-56ad-4745-a7c2-3d1e77a648fe
(hbnb)
zekarias@zekarias-virtual-machine:~/AirBnB_clone$ ./console.py
```
